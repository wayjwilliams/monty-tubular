<p>Watch Monty Python sketches. Let them play one by one or refresh the page for a new sketch</p>
<p>I wanted to play with Sean McCambridge's <a href="http://www.seanmccambridge.com/tubular/">Tubular</a> jquery plugin pulling from YouTube's API, but wanted multiple videos to show up as the background and wanted them to sort randomly when refreshing the page.</p>
<p>You can create a playlist in YouTube, but even then they try to give you tons of "suggestions" or anticipate what else you might want to watch. I just want to watch Python skits! So I made my own app.</p>
